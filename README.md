# MetalCommander-AndroidGame

### Introduction:
Metal Commander is a strategic role-playing game for mobile devices based on the popular Nintendo franchise, Fire Emblem. This project was developed with the purpose of serving as an educational exercise for one of the courses I took during my time in university.

### Roles: 
Game Developer, Game Programmer, Level Designer, Level Implementation, Version Control, Design and programming of movement mechanics, combat, statistics, game manager, Enemy AI.

### Tags: 
Mobile, strategy, role-playing, pixel-art.

### Core:
Metal Commander's core is divided into two essential parts. The strategic component is marked by the movement mechanic, developed using the A* pathfinding algorithm, and the classic turn-based combat system of Fire Emblem RPG games. On the other hand, the other component lies in the story, developed chapter by chapter, featuring compelling characters.
